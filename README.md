# Firebase SDK for Java

This is the unofficial Firebase SDK for pure Java.

With this SDK it is possible to develop applications for end users using Firebase technologies.

> This SDK is still under development.

## How it works
This SDK is completely based on the Rest API which can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest).

This SDK contains some official peculiarities, such as the persistence mode, which must be defined manually.
